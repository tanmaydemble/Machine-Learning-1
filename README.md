This repository includes code examples of various machine learning models that I learnt about over the period of January 2024 and April 2024. This repo includes implementation of various models such as linear regression,
logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Trees, Ensemble Modelling including Bagging and Boosting. Some of the libraries I used during this project were sklearn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
